 The first cvd notebook is one of my earlier attempts at creating a mildly successful architecture. In hindsight, I should've either dropped or scaled the age column down.
 
 The second one is a more updated version using a new dataset, and I trained/tested three separate models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree). I was decently happy with the ~85% accuracy I got on all three given how small the dataset was.
