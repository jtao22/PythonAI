This notebook predicts the price of bitcoin with an extremely high accuracy, but the dataset is huge and therefore computationally expensive to train on. I used a Random Forest Regressor in this case.

Because the dataset is really large (over 200MB), I attached the link to the Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data
