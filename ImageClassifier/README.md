V1 is a rudimentary, if not semi inaccurate image classifier that uses a convolutional neural network. I am working on improving the accuracy.
V2 uses an artifical neural network instead to classify images of various pieces of clothing. I'd say this dataset was definitely a lot simpler to work with.
