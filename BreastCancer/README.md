The first model is trained to use information on the characteristics of a cell to determine if it is malignant or benign. I reached around 95% accuracy on the test data, and used three different algorithms/architectures (logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree). 

The second model was a fun exercise I did with a much less detailed dataset I found on kaggle. Evidently, the model itself is much less accurate as well.
